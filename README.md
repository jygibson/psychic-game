# psychic-game

This is homework assignment #3 for my coding class. The assignment is create a game where the user guesses a key in an attempt to guess the same key the computer is "thinking of" (randomly generated). 

It will combine html, css, and javascript. 

First, I will psuedocode the game to figure out what I need to do, including the steps and variable.

Second, I will write the html for what information is needed on the page, including game instructions, and the score. 

Third, I will make it 'meh-pretty' using css. 

Fourth, I will create the javascript to make it functional. maybe. hopefully. 

Fifth, once it works, I will go back and make it prettier using css. 

Sixth, #nailedit, will move on and try to create the word guess game.

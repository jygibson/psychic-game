<!--we will need the instructions on the page:
Guess what letter I'm thinking of!
wins
losses
guesses left
your guesses so far

the game will need to record the keystrokes of the user- document.onkeyup(event)
it will need to apply math for computer to pick a random letter from an array math.floor(math.random) or whatever it was
it will need to compare the two results (if/else statements)

user gets 9 guesses
if the user guesses the same letter as the computer generates, it will increase the wins score by 1
if the user guesses the wrong letter, it will decrease the guesses left column by 1 ( i--) 
all keystrokes are recorded next to guesses so far
after 9 guesses, the losses counter will increase by 1. The game will reset (chosen letters back to none)!-->
